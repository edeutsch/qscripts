Regis cluster usage summary

#### Cluster information
qhelp        # This summary
qnodes       # List the current set of cluster nodes and how busy they are
qshow        # Show all current jobs running and queued
qshowmine    # Show my jobs, running and queued

#### Data conversion
qconvert *.raw     # Convert all .raw files to mzML files
qconvert *.d       # Convert all timsTOF .d folders to mzML files

#### Submitting searches
qcomet *.mzML         # Search all mzMLs in current directory with Comet
qmsfragger *.mzML     # Search all mzMLs in current directory with MSFragger
qmsfragger -s 10 -b 2 *.mzML   # Search all mzMLs with MSFragger with database split into 10 pieces
                                 and only two mzMLs batched together
qtandem *.mzML        # Search all mzMLs in current directory with X!Tandem

#### Running TPP processing on a cluster node (not on the current interactive machine)

## Immediately run xinteract on all 20*.pep.xml files
srun -p urgent xinteract -OZ -PPM -Ninteract-prob.pep.xml 20*.pep.xml

## Immediately run iProphet with 32 threads
srun -c 32 -p urgent InterProphetParser THREADS=32 interact-prob.pep.xml interact-ipro.pep.xml

## Immediately run ProteinProphet
srun -p urgent ProteinProphet interact-ipro.pep.xml interact-prob.prot.xml IPROPHET NONSP

#### Submitting a batch job to do something
cat > myjob.sh           # (or you can use your favorite editor: pico myjob.sh)
#!/bin/bash
xinteract -OZ -PPM -Ninteract-prob.pep.xml 20*.pep.xml
InterProphetParser THREADS=32 interact-prob.pep.xml interact-ipro.pep.xml
ProteinProphet interact-ipro.pep.xml interact-prob.prot.xml IPROPHET NONSP
^D        # (type CTRL + D to finish the file)
chmod a+x myjob.sh           # Make the file executable
